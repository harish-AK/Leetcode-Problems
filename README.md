      1. Two sum problem - Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
      
      Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
      Output: [0,1]
      Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

      2.Given an integer x, return true if x is a 
      palindrome, and false otherwise.
      
      Example 1:
      Input: x = 121
      Output: true
      Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

      3.Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.
      Symbol       Value
      I             1
      V             5
      X             10
      L             50
      C             100
      D             500
      M             1000
      
      Example 2:
      Input: s = "LVIII"
      Output: 58
      Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.

      4. Remove duplicates in a sorted array (2 poiter used to solve this problem)
      Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. 
      The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.
      Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:
      Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. 
      The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
      Return k.
      
      Example 1:
      Input: nums = [1,1,2]
      Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
      Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
      It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

      5.Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".
      
      Example 1:
      Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
      Output: "fl"
      
      Example 2:
      Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
      Output: ""
      Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.

      6.Convert integer to roman, For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. 
      The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.
      
      Example 1:
      Input: num = 3
      Output: "III"
      Explanation: 3 is represented as 3 ones.
