    1. Two sum problem - Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
    Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
    Output: [0,1]
    Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

    2.Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.
    Input: x = 121
    Output: true
    Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
